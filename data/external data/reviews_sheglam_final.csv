s***1;2024.10.27;5.0;As a darkskin women, its so hard to find a blush that looks good on you. This is the first blush I truly enjoy and look good in. It has a dewy finish rather than a pale/ashy look to it. I would say you have too layer on the blush though cause it‚Äôs not that noticeable if you only blend out one layer.
a***m;2024.09.23;5.0;This is the first liquid blush I‚Äôve had and love it
b***t;2024.09.05;5.0;I'm obsessed with how light it is and the color is perfect

A***M;2024.08.05;5.0;This is my first time using a blush like this, I usually use powder. Holy moly, this is a game changer! It's bright, super easy to apply, blends nicely. I've not had any breakouts since starting to use this a month ago. My biggest gripe is that the bottle is small, but honestly, you get what you pay for and it lasts a good while. I'll definitely be buying again :)

B***z;2024.07.29;5.0;I saw so many videos on tiktok and the blush did not disappoint it stayed on all night and was very easy to blend !!! Love it and can‚Äôt wait to try more shades !!
H***h;2024.07.25;5.0;"Very Transparent and On Point- I'm a very fair woman, and I love the shades you can accomplish with this one blush..... Less for a lighter flush glow, more for that going out ""rougie"" cheek (that's my going out term- rouge and bougie together lol) Now on the other hand, my daughter who has a very olive skin tone, can also achieve the same glow, but bc of the  transparentness with the pink tint,  with her skin tone it looks great, just a pink fit to her.  Try it once,  you'll be hooked like me.  I've now moved on to the liquid contours.... love love love loving them too!"
H***i;2024.07.15;5.0;i purchased 3 bottle of this blusher!!! the color and texture is giving girl!

A***d;2024.04.29;5.0;I had never used blush in liquid form. I have an e.l.f brush and it goes on so well!  It's a bit bright if I use too much so using less is best!  You can always add more but taking some off is a little tricky as it dries instantly. I love it!!  So much fun to use and the color is perfect for me!  YAY!

M***o;2024.02.27;5.0;Let's talk about the pigmentation of this product. I had never used a liquid blush before and this product has made me a convert! The colour is absolutely stunning and blends like a dream.

m***2;2024.02.12;5.0;I fell in love with the color of this blush straight away. I love how it just compliments my skin color so much and it just glides smoothly on my skin. I love it so much.
I***n;2024.02.11;5.0;One word: Amazing!
T***R;2024.02.10;5.0;Love the color payoff
h***e;2024.02.07;5.0;"Love this liquid blush, hands down the best blush I have ever tried. The application allows to apply the product precisely and the creamy consistency allows for it to blend out beautifully. The colour ""Birthday Suit"" is the perfect natural shade on my olive skin tone and the colour lasts all day. Its also buildable for more of a evening make-up look, however I persoanlly prefer just to use 1 or 2 dots on each cheek bone before blending out. Looking forward to try out the glow versions in the summer and the contour colours. In short AMAZING BLUSH"
L***i;2024.02.07;5.0;I am really amaze about your service and also the products. I was scared that it would be a cheap product with a cheap finish but honestly I have nothing to say bad about them. And also, your proximity with clients is really promising, I was glad to receive an answer rapidly.

H***A;2024.01.31;5.0;I used it everyday! The only tip I have is to use a setting spray to blend easily and smoothly. I use a two dots and it‚Äôs my perfect rosy look.
M***t;2024.01.29;5.0;I was hesitant at first because I typically don't like sponge applicators but this blush is perfect. The color is the prettiest baby pink and it blends like a dream. Extremely buildable if you want more color.

I put a few dots wherever I want it, and it leaves my cheeks looking beautiful and rosey. I like to set it with my translucent powder and it stays quite well. I highly recommend, as long as you aren't sensitive to smells. It's not a bad smell, in fact, it smells delicious! But I am aware that some people cannot handle scents, so beware! Overall, it's a wonderful blush and I love it."

I would say the only downside I have noticed is by the afternoon I feel like it has worn off because I become shiny. I am going to try some setting powder to see if that helps but otherwise love the product and colors!

- I have dark skin and I didn‚Äôt have to put on layer upon layer for it to show up
My only complaint is that it wears off pretty easily. At the end of the day it‚Äôs barely visible BUT I don‚Äôt use a setting spray so that could be it LOL"
S***r;2023.05.31;4.0;It‚Äôs easy to blend not too pigmented but slow to arrive to my house. Otherwise great productüòÄ
H***y;2023.05.03;4.0;Nice color but more peachy orange than it showed on the website. I dont recommend blending with beauty blender because it absorbs the product and takes away the pigment. Blend with sheglam paw print blush brush! Love how the blush feels on skin.

N***w;2023.02.12;4.0;Color Bloom Liquid Blush Matte Finish-Rose Ritual
S***o;2023.01.31;4.0;This blush is beautiful and blends well, but is a little light for my skin tone so I have to layer a lot.
d***n;2023.01.12;4.0;the applicator is amazing, and the blush has a great consistency and blends wel
V***n;2022.10.30;4.0;love the blush a lot! super pretty color! wish there was more product though
L***.;2022.10.26;4.0;"Just a hint of sheer color is left, very fresh and natural looking. I have a olive complexion that is normal-dry. Just what you want for a daily look, I reach for this constantly. Let‚Äôs your true skin, shhhh it‚Äôs our secret, shine through. Very easy to just lightly tap in, and easy to blend.
However, I did need to touch up as the color seems to fade. That‚Äôs why this only get 4/5 stars."
A***n;2022.09.09;4.0;Color Bloom Liquid Blush-Hush Hush
A***J;2022.08.24;4.0;These are super easy to blend (I usually use my fingers) and are highly pigmented. I usually only need 1 dot on each cheek for the flush of color I like. I like the applicator, I think it is fun and different. The packaging is cute, I just worry about how much product is in it and whether it will last a while. Would definitely buy again in more colors
O***l;2022.05.28;4.0;Color Bloom Liquid Blush-Rose Ritual
P***n;2022.04.10;4.0;only problem is that I picked out a color that was a bit too light, but can apply more to adjust it better.
K***f;2024.09.05;3.0;Color Bloom Liquid Blush-Hot Topic
S***e;2024.08.08;3.0;It feels so light on the skin but is not pigmented.
F***A;2024.04.26;3.0;Il prodotto in s√© √® carino, ma il colore √® davvero troppo chiaro. Tenete conto che non ho la pelle lattea, ma nemmeno scura e su di me la tinta non si vede assolutamente.
t***o;2024.03.24;3.0;the package was damaged, so impossible to gift, but product inside was OK
M***3;2024.02.25;3.0;its a solid pink type of blush yet i wished it would've been more true to the image colour wich shows a pink with more of a redish undertone unlike petal talk which has a cooler undertone. this one feels more like a middle colour that tries to be both yet neither. nonetheless good pigmentation and easy to blend out. the packaging feels lux for such a low pricepoint wich is really refreshing
P***o;2024.02.12;3.0;Very pigmented have a hard time learn how to use it
Z***E;2023.10.03;3.0;I love the color Night Drive, but there was little to no product in the actual container. Very disappointing. It almost looked empty.
A***n;2022.12.07;3.0;I thought it looked like a cool-toned pale pink when I looked at it online. But when it got there I realized it was more of a coral pink blush. Super long lasting and pigmented though.
L***.;2022.10.26;3.0;I have olive skin that is normal-dry. This blush is a very highly pigmented color of the sheerest red color that looks intimidating but blends beautiful giving you that glam color needed for a date night. It doesn‚Äôt stay though so only giving it 3 stars. Great concept  but color just didn‚Äôt set all night.
L***.;2022.10.26;3.0;I have an olive complexion, this color was a sheer peachy/pink color. It looked a little clownish at first, a little goes a long way. Very pigmented, but then quickly blended to a freshly pinched cheek color. Although I like the concept of this, it lets your skin shine through‚Ä¶ the color just doesn‚Äôt stay and needs to be reapplied often. That‚Äôs why I gave it 3/5.
D***n;2022.10.17;3.0;"I tried this as soon as I got it and I loved the color and it stayed very well. But I actually contacted customer service and told them that there is no possible way to get more of the product on the sponge because it is too short! I you hold it next to the bottle, it is easy to see that you will never get the product that you paid for out of there! It cannot reach. So you are going to get what the very tip can touch and if you use it alot, once that is gone, you won't get any more product. It will literally be sitting in the bottom of the bottle with no way to get it out since the neck of the bottle  is so narrow. Throwing your money away. It's too bad because it's a great blush. But you all know what I;m saying. It's the same way with every lip gloss with a wand out there. they make it too short to reach the bottom so you throw away product. I told them this when it first launched and was sad to see they didn't care and did not change the applicator length. Sad."
S***A;2022.10.11;3.0;I like the concept of this blush. Hush hush was the color I chose and at first I thought I really liked it. I wanted something subtle but it may be too subtle for the cheeks. It faded quickly and I‚Äôm not one to reapply. Good concept not a great color for me.
J***s;2022.08.17;3.0;I really love the formula of this blush. I took the time to find a good cool tone, but what I thought was a mauve-y pink was much more peach than the site indicated to me.
Y***e;2024.11.23;1.0;Beautiful color, just not for my skin tone
C***s;2023.08.06;5.0;I absolutely loved the products I got from SHEGLAM! The eyeshadow primer was so effective and left my eye looks brighter and longer lasting.
